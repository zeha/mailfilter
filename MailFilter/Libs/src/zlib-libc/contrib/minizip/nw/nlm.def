# If this NLM is written correctly, its threads (if more than one) should be
# able to run on any processor completely in parallel with each other. For this
# to occur, however, it must be marked as MP-safe. This is done using a special
# tool, mpkxdc.exe:
#
#		mpkxdc -n hello.xdc
#
# Other possibilities exist. For example, a list of functions that aren't safe
# to migrate off processor 0 can be created using the same tool and a list in
# a text file. See the Novell NDK documentation for more details.
#
# Ultimately, the output from this tool, hello.xdc, is then set into the linked
# NLM using this command:
#
# XDCDATA	hello.xdc
