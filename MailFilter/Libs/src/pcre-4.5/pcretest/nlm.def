# Sample .DEF file

MODULE clib.nlm
# Specifies the modules that must be loaded before this NLM is loaded.
# These modules will be loaded automatically when this NLM is loaded.
# In addition to this list, with CodeWarrior for NetWare any NLM modules
# added to the project are also added to the autoload list.
# Example: MODULE clib.nlm dsapi.nlm

# IMPORT symbol list
# IMPORT @symbol list file
# Specifies a list, or a file containing a list (import file) of symbols 
# which will be externally resolved at runtime.
# In addition to this list, with CodeWarrior for NetWare there are two
# other methods for specifying import symbols:
#  1 - Add unpacked NLM modules to the project.  All its symbols 
#      will be added to this list.
#  2 - Add Import files to the project
# Example: IMPORT ConsolePrintf scanf 
# Example: IMPORT @C:\nwsdk\imports\clib.imp

# EXPORT symbol list
# EXPORT @symbol list file
# Specifies a list, or a file containing a list of symbols 
# which will be exported at runtime.
# Example: EXPORT MyConsolePrintf MyScanf
# Example: EXPORT @C:\myexp.exp

# DATE month, day, year
# Allows the Date in the NLM header to be manually specified.  
# By default this date is the date the NLM was built.
# Example: DATE 7, 23,  1998
